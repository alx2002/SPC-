4. Start multiple clients, locate to the char selection screen on all of them  
5. Press Multi Button, put the leader account name into them and press save (might have to press save multiple times)  
6. Enter nexus with them  
7. On your main account*, open Options, locate to the Worlds tab, and turn "Multibox".
